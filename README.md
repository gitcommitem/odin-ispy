# TOP Javascript Course Project - I Spy

05/18/2022 ~ 05/27/2022

## Objectives

Using Firebase, create a I-spy / Where's Waldo type game

Your game should include the following:

- Include a timer that counts how long it takes for the user to find all items
- Include a leaderboard that shows the best times

## Learnings

Still getting a feel for how to code in react. Learning firebase / firestore along with what react hooks to use took a bit of time. Definitely could go back and clean up some code and make sure things are more consistent.
